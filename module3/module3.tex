\section*{2. FEFG and }
\emph{Introduce periodic (Born-von Karman) boundary conditions and derive the density of states (DOS) for FEFG in a finite 3D sample. Calculate values of $\varepsilon_F$, $k_F$, $v_F$ and $T_F$, i.e. Fermi energy, wavevector, velocity and temperature, respectively, for alkali metals. Explain the trend.}\\

A FEFG in 3D can at first approximation be described by the free particle Schr√∂dinger equation in three dimensions
\begin{equation}
	-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \bm{\psi_k}(r) = \bm{\epsilon_k}\bm{\psi_k}(\bm{r})
	\label{SE}
\end{equation}

Confining the electrons to a cube whose sides have length $L$ we get the following solution for the wavefunctions
\begin{equation}
	\bm{\psi}_n(\bm{r}) = A\sin(\pi n_xx/L)\sin(\pi n_yy/L)\sin(\pi n_zz/L), \quad n_x,n_y,n_z \in \mathbb{Z}
\end{equation}

Next we want to apply Born-von Karman boundary conditions. The Born-von Karman boundary condition can be represented mathematically as certain restrictions on the wavefunction in a crystal under the assumption that the wavefunction is periodic. The condition can be stated as
	\begin{equation}
		\bm{\psi}(x+L,y,z)=\bm{\psi}(x,y,z)
		\label{condition} 
	\end{equation}
For the $x$-direction and similarly for $y$ and $z$.

This is a classical particle in box problem that we know from quantum mechanics. The boundary conditions gives us the familiar solution of
\begin{equation}
	\bm{\psi_k}(\bm{r})e^{i\bm{k}\cdot\bm{r}}
	\label{pwave}
\end{equation}
With the special requirement that the wavevectors are on the form
$$ \bm{k}_x = \frac{2n_x\pi}{L} $$

It is easily shown that this satisfies equation \eqref{condition}
\begin{align*}
	\exp(i\bm{k}\cdot\bm{r}) = \exp(i\bm{k}\cdot(\bm{r}+L\bm{e}_x))\\
	\exp(i\bm{k}\cdot\bm{r}) = \exp(i\bm{k}\cdot\bm{r}) \cdot \exp(iL\bm k_x)\\
	\exp(iL\bm k_x) = 1 \implies Lk_x = 2n_x\pi
\end{align*}

Substituting equation \eqref{pwave} into \eqref{SE} we get an expression for the energies related to each wavevector
\begin{equation}
 	2
\end{equation}
